  <summary>How do we debug the next line of code?
</summary>
  <p>To debug just some parts of the code we need to select it first, right-click on the selection and choose to debug those specific lines. At that point on the Variables panel at the bottom of the page we can see the objects and the variables involved in the code and investigate them, accessing the values associated with each. After changing the code, we need to rerun the debugger for it to reread the code.</p>
